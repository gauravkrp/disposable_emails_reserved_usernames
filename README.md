Hello! The the two files uploaded here helps you in building a better validation system of forms on your website/application.
1. disposable_email.json contains list of domains that provides disposable/temporary emails. These emails expire after certain period of time (say 10 minutes) and become invalid. Use it to filter spammers spamming your database with false emails.
2. reserved_usernames.json contains list of words which are abusive or doctionary words that you cannot use as name/username on your web form.

Found some other lists like this? Let me know. Also you are welcome to update these two files with more such emails/usernames.

#Love to contribute/share.
